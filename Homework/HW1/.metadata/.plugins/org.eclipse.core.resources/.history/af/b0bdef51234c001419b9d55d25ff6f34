/*push(dataItem): enters the data item onto the stack and returns nothing.
pop(): throws an exception if the stack is empty; otherwise returns the top element, removing it from the stack.
peek(): throws an exception if the stack is empty; otherwise returns the top element of the stack. However, unlike pop, it does not change the contents of the stack.
isEmpty(): returns true if there are no items in the stack; false otherwise.
clear(): makes the stack empty.
popWasLast(): returns true if the last push, pop, or clear operation was a pop and false otherwise. If neither a push nor a pop nor a clear has yet been executed, then false is returned.
getSize(): returns the number elements currently in the stack.
